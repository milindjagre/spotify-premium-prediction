#### In today's business world, if you want to stay ahead of the competition, it is essential to make proper use of the information you possess. Analytics has given us the power to use this data efficiently in making a decision.

#### This project for predicting potential customers who are willing to buy a monthly subscription for Spotify. It aims to help marketing team to identify target customers and design marketing campaign accordingly. Thereby saving unnecessary expenses and employee overhead.

#### I along with my colleague for this project,  Anupama Kamdi, hope to develop a prediction model using basic regression techniques using excel and R-programming. Currently, the project is in its initial stages, and I will be uploading subsequent updates for the same.
